# iris-0.1
Have you ever wanted a specific account's tweets to be reported directly to a Discord channel? 

Iris listens to a  twitter user you want to follow, captures that accounts tweets in text / photo form, and then reports it to your Discord.

Iris works on private accounts, can capture images, and has more features on the way.....
